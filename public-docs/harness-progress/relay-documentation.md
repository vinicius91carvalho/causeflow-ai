## 2026-07-08T14:01:38.896Z — Explicit Resume

- WorkItem: WI-AC-019
- Outcome: user authorized a new Attempt cycle
- Guidance: Root cause fixed: pi's model was requesting near-uncapped max_tokens against a zero-balance OpenRouter account, causing every call to 402. Switched to a free, explicitly-capped model (qwen/qwen3-coder:free, maxTokens:8192) and restarted. Fresh retry.

## 2026-07-08T16:05:38.022Z — Explicit Resume

- WorkItem: WI-AC-019
- Outcome: user authorized a new Attempt cycle
- Guidance: Confirmed via the log-detail fix: this block was pure OpenRouter 429 rate-limit exhaustion on qwen3-coder:free (8 req/min), not a real coding/QA defect -- the Work Item was never actually attempted. Also fixed the root cause (orchestrator now backs off before retrying after a 429 instead of instantly re-exhausting the same limit). Retry.

## 2026-07-08T16:43:12.186Z — Explicit Resume

- WorkItem: WI-AC-019
- Outcome: user authorized a new Attempt cycle
- Guidance: Confirmed pure OpenRouter 429 rate-limit exhaustion again, not a real defect. Root-caused the persistent contention: openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder:free's 8 req/min limit is shared across the whole account and further saturated by external OpenRouter demand -- even with backoff+jitter, 4 concurrent subprojects kept exhausting it. Switched the pi adapter to NVIDIA NIM's deepseek-v4-pro (separate unshared quota pool, 40 req/min, verified reachable). Retry.

## 2026-07-08T17:52:40.499Z — Explicit Resume

- WorkItem: WI-AC-019
- Outcome: user authorized a new Attempt cycle
- Guidance: This block was a real bug in my own config, not a code defect: the previous pi adapter switch referenced a made-up provider key (nvidia-nim) in models.json that pi never actually recognized -- it needed either an explicit 'api' field (unrecognized custom provider) or credentials in ~/.pi/agent/auth.json under pi's real native provider key, neither of which was done. Fixed: credentials now in auth.json under the correct native keys (nvidia, opencode-go), and the adapter points at opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash (much higher throughput ceiling, verified working end-to-end via a direct pi invocation before this retry). Retry.
