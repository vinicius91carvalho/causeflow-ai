## WI-AC-045 — `.env.example` cleanup for open-source-local-runtime

**State:** `implementation=true`

**Summary:**
- Removed `NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_URL` from `apps/website/.env.example` — the AC specifies only the two analytics keys (`NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLARITY_ID`) should ship in the website example file.
- Verified `apps/dashboard/.env.example` already ships with only `CORE_API_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and optional `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLARITY_ID`.
- Verified no `CLERK_*`, `STRIPE_*`, `AWS_*`, `SENTRY_*`, `LOOPS_*`, or SST-injected vars in either file (AC-045 Step 1 pass).
- Verified docker-compose.yml mounts the same `JWT_SECRET` default for both `causeflow-api` (line 98) and `causeflow-dashboard` (line 171) — `oss-dev-jwt-secret-change-me` matches the .env.example default (AC-045 Step 3 pass).
- Both apps build successfully after the change.

**Previous blocks:** All prior blocks were caused by the pi adapter's credential configuration (nvidia-nim provider key not recognized), not by code defects. With the correct native provider keys in `auth.json`, the implementation completes cleanly.
