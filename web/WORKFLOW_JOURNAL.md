## WI-AC-045 — `.env.example` cleanup for open-source-local-runtime

**State:** `implementation=true`

**Summary:**
- Removed `NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_URL` from `apps/website/.env.example` — the AC specifies only the two analytics keys (`NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLARITY_ID`) should ship in the website example file.
- Verified `apps/dashboard/.env.example` already ships with only `CORE_API_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and optional `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLARITY_ID`.
- Verified no `CLERK_*`, `STRIPE_*`, `AWS_*`, `SENTRY_*`, `LOOPS_*`, or SST-injected vars in either file (AC-045 Step 1 pass).
- Verified docker-compose.yml mounts the same `JWT_SECRET` default for both `causeflow-api` (line 98) and `causeflow-dashboard` (line 171) — `oss-dev-jwt-secret-change-me` matches the .env.example default (AC-045 Step 3 pass).
- Both apps build successfully after the change.

**Previous blocks:** All prior blocks were caused by the pi adapter's credential configuration (nvidia-nim provider key not recognized), not by code defects. With the correct native provider keys in `auth.json`, the implementation completes cleanly.

## QA Verification (WI-AC-045)

**Run by:** qa-agent on 2026-07-08

**Verdict:** `implementation=true, qa=true`

**Checks performed:**

1. **apps/website/.env.example** — PASS
   - Contains exactly `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLARITY_ID` (both blank = optional no-op)
   - No `CLERK_*`, `STRIPE_*`, `AWS_*`, `SENTRY_*`, `LOOPS_*`, or SST vars
   - `LOOPS_API_KEY` is absent (removed per AC)

2. **apps/dashboard/.env.example** — PASS
   - Contains `CORE_API_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLARITY_ID`
   - `CORE_API_URL=http://causeflow-api:5171` matches docker-compose.yml internal network URL
   - `JWT_SECRET=oss-dev-jwt-secret-change-me` matches docker-compose.yml default for both `causeflow-api` and `causeflow-dashboard`
   - No `CLERK_*`, `STRIPE_*`, `AWS_*`, `SENTRY_*`, `LOOPS_*`, or SST vars

3. **Git tracking** — PASS — Both files tracked and committed as part of WI-AC-045

**Observation (non-blocking):** The project_specs.xml AC-045 description states CORE_API_URL default should be `http://core-api:3099`. The actual docker-compose.yml service is named `causeflow-api` (not `core-api`) and listens on port `5171` internally (port `3099` is the external host binding). The .env.example correctly uses `http://causeflow-api:5171`. This is a spec-text inaccuracy, not a functional defect — the implementation is internally consistent and correct.

## WI-AC-046 — Local JWT auth replaces Clerk

**State:** `implementation=true`

**Summary:**
- Middleware (`apps/dashboard/src/middleware.ts`) no longer imports `clerkMiddleware`. It reads the `__session` httpOnly cookie and decodes the JWT payload (signature verified server-side by `withAuth` via Core whoami). Edge Runtime cannot run `jose`'s compression APIs, so full verification is deferred.
- `with-auth.ts` completely rewritten: extracts the `__session` cookie from the request, calls the Core's `GET /api/v1/auth/me` (whoami) with `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`, and resolves `userId` + `tenantId` + `role` from the response. Falls back to local JWT claims when Core API is unavailable (mock mode).
- `get-backend-token.ts` rewritten: reads `__session` cookie from request or server-side cookie store (no Clerk dependency).
- Created `lib/auth/session-auth.ts` — server-side JWT verification using `jose` (for Node.js route handlers).
- Created `lib/auth/get-server-auth.ts` — server component helper using `cookies()` from `next/headers`.
- Created `contexts/shared/presentation/components/auth-context.tsx` — client-side `AuthProvider`, `useAuth()`, `useUser()` hooks replacing Clerk's equivalents.
- Sign-in/sign-up pages were already local React forms (no Clerk components).
- `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/logout` already proxy to Core API and set `__session` cookie.
- All Clerk imports removed from source files (20+ files updated).
- `@clerk/nextjs`, `@clerk/themes`, `@clerk/localizations`, `@clerk/testing` removed from `package.json`.
- Clerk optimize entries removed from `next.config.mjs`.
- `clerk-appearance.ts`, `clerk-overrides.css`, `clerk-theme-provider.test.tsx` deleted.
- Topbar rewritten: no `OrganizationSwitcher`/`UserButton` — replaced with local avatar + logout button.
- Server components (integrations page, incident detail, create org, etc.) updated to use local auth helpers.
- Client components (role-guard, team table, approvals list, choose plan, profile tab, use-is-staff, accept invitation, waitlist, team page, settings page) updated to use local auth context.
- API handlers (slack-config, sentry-integration, complete-profile) updated to use `getSessionFromRequest`.
- Test files updated: Clerk mocks replaced with session-auth mocks; topbar tests rewritten for new implementation.
- Build succeeds; dev server serves sign-in (200), sign-up (200); unauthenticated `/dashboard` redirects to `/auth/sign-in` (307).
- All 165 dashboard test files pass (1080 tests).
