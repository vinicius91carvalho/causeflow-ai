name: plan-build-test
description: Local-only feature builder that plans, implements, and tests code using agent teams — all locally, no deploy. Use this skill when the user describes a problem, feature request, bug, or improvement to build. Triggers on phrases like "build this", "implement", "create feature", "fix this problem", "add functionality", or when user provides a feature description to execute. Also triggers when user wants to work through pending task files. After local testing completes, user manually verifies, then uses /ship-test-ensure to deploy and validate quality.

# Plan, Build & Test — Local Development Workflow

Plan, implement, and test features entirely locally: discover tasks, simplify, plan, implement with agent teams, run all tests and E2E locally, then learn. No commits, no deploys, no staging — that's what `/ship-test-ensure` is for after you've manually verified.

Operate as a **Team Lead** coordinating specialist agents — using parallel worktrees for independent tasks and sequential execution for dependent ones.

**Inherited from CLAUDE.md** (applies to all phases below):
- Context Engineering — orchestrator pattern, subagent communication, context budget
- Model Assignment Matrix — haiku/sonnet/opus per task type
- Parallel Execution with Worktrees — batch planning, isolation, merge protocol
- Session Learnings — compact-safe memory at `session-learnings.md`
- Self-Improvement Protocol — compile, persist, generate rules

**Inherited from patterns.md** (applies to all phases below):
- Troubleshooting patterns — known gotchas and their solutions
- Environment knowledge — .env.local usage, port conflicts, CWD requirements

---

## PHASE 0: RESUME GATE (Always Runs First)

**This phase determines where to start. It prevents the loop of re-discovery when a plan already exists.**

### Step 0.1: Read Session Learnings

Read `session-learnings.md` from the project's memory directory. Check for:
- `## Active Task Queue` — already-planned batches with task files
- `## Parallel Batch Plan` — batch structure (parallel/sequential, models, dependencies)
- `## Execution Mode` — user's chosen mode (autonomous, step-by-step, etc.)
- Task statuses: `NOT STARTED`, `IN PROGRESS`, `COMPLETE`

### Step 0.2: Route Decision

| Session Learnings State | Action |
|---|---|
| **Has Active Task Queue with NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS tasks** | **SKIP to Phase 2** (Execution). The plan exists. Do NOT re-discover. Do NOT re-ask the user for execution mode. |
| **Has Active Task Queue but ALL tasks are COMPLETE** | Go to Phase 5 (Learning) if compound wasn't done, otherwise tell user all tasks are complete. |
| **No Active Task Queue OR file doesn't exist** | Go to Phase 1 (Discovery) — this is a fresh start. |
| **User explicitly described a NEW task** (not in any task file) | Go to Phase 1 (Discovery) to scan existing tasks AND create a new task file for the user's request. |

**The key rule: If session learnings already have a plan with pending tasks, EXECUTE IT. Don't re-plan.**

---

## Phase 1: Discovery (Pending Task Scanner)

**Only runs when Phase 0 routes here (no existing plan in session learnings).**

### Step 1.1: Spawn Discovery Agent

Spawn a single **Explore agent** (`subagent_type: "Explore"`, `model: "haiku"`) with this prompt:

> Search all markdown files in `docs/tasks/` for unchecked items (`- [ ]`). For each file that contains pending items:
> 1. Return the full file path
> 2. Count the number of `- [ ]` (pending) and `- [x]` (completed) items
> 3. List each pending item's text
> 4. List ALL files referenced or likely modified by each pending item (look for file paths, component names, page names in the item text)
>
> Also check if the user's current request describes a NEW task that doesn't have a task file yet.
>
> Return results grouped by file, sorted by modification date (oldest first).

### Step 1.2: Process Discovery Results

Based on the discovery agent's results, determine the work queue:

- **If pending items exist in existing task files:** Add them to the session learnings `## Active Task Queue`
- **If the user described a NEW feature/bug:** Create a new task file following CLAUDE.md conventions (location: `docs/tasks/<app>/<category>/YYYY-MM-DD_HHmm-descriptive-name.md`), write the plan inside it, and add it to the queue

---

## Phase 1.5: Dependency Analysis & Parallel Batch Planning

### Step 1.5.1: Analyze Task Independence

Spawn a **general-purpose agent** (`model: "haiku"`) to analyze dependencies using the **Batch Planning** rules from CLAUDE.md:

> Given these task files and their pending items:
> [LIST TASK FILES WITH THEIR PENDING ITEMS AND REFERENCED FILES FROM DISCOVERY]
>
> Determine which tasks are **independent** vs **dependent** (see CLAUDE.md criteria).
>
> Return a JSON structure:
> ```json
> {
>   "batches": [
>     { "batch": 1, "tasks": ["task1.md", "task2.md"], "parallel": true, "reason": "touch different pages" },
>     { "batch": 2, "tasks": ["task3.md"], "parallel": false, "reason": "depends on task1 shared layout changes" }
>   ],
>   "dependency_graph": { "task3.md": ["task1.md"] }
> }
> ```
>
> When in doubt, mark tasks as DEPENDENT.

### Step 1.5.2: Assign Models to Tasks

For each task, determine complexity and assign a model per the CLAUDE.md Model Assignment Matrix:

- **Simple** (lint fixes, typo corrections, single-file changes): `haiku`
- **Standard** (feature implementation, bug fixes, test writing, scoped multi-file): `sonnet`
- **Complex** (architectural changes, cross-cutting refactors, 5+ files): `opus`

### Step 1.5.3: Present Execution Plan to User

Display the discovered queue with parallel batches, then ask:

> "I found N task files with M pending items total, organized into B batches:
>
> **Batch 1 (parallel — worktree isolation):**
> - `path/to/task1.md` — X pending items (model: sonnet)
> - `path/to/task2.md` — Y pending items (model: haiku)
>
> **Batch 2 (sequential — depends on Batch 1):**
> - `path/to/task3.md` — Z pending items (model: opus)
>
> How should I execute?"

Use `AskUserQuestion` with these options (MANDATORY — always present all):

- **Start fresh context (Recommended)** — Save the complete plan to session-learnings.md (Active Task Queue, Parallel Batch Plan, execution mode set to "Autonomous"), then tell the user: "Plan saved. Start a new conversation and run `/plan-build-test` — it will pick up exactly where we left off and execute autonomously. Current context usage: ~X%." This preserves maximum context for execution.
- **Auto-start fresh context** — Same as above, but after saving the plan, automatically start a new Claude Code session by running: `claude -p "/plan-build-test"`. The new session picks up the plan from session-learnings.md and executes autonomously. No manual intervention needed.
- **Run all autonomously** — Execute all batches (parallel where safe) without stopping in the current session
- **Run all step-by-step** — Pause after each batch for confirmation
- **Select specific tasks** — Let me choose which task files to work on

When the user selects **"Start fresh context"**:
1. Write the full plan to `session-learnings.md` with `## Execution Mode: Autonomous`
2. Set all task statuses to `NOT STARTED`
3. Output to the user: "Plan saved to session-learnings.md. Start a new `/plan-build-test` conversation to execute. Current context: ~X%."
4. **STOP. Do not execute anything.** The next invocation's Phase 0 will pick it up.

When the user selects **"Auto-start fresh context"**:
1. Write the full plan to `session-learnings.md` with `## Execution Mode: Autonomous`
2. Set all task statuses to `NOT STARTED`
3. Output to the user: "Plan saved. Launching new session to execute..."
4. Run: `claude -p "/plan-build-test"` to start a new session that will pick up the plan
5. **STOP the current session.**

---

## Phase 2: Parallel Batch Execution with Worktrees

Execute task batches in order. Follow the **Parallel Execution with Worktrees** protocol from CLAUDE.md.

### Step 2.1: For Each Batch in the Queue

**Before spawning agents:**
1. Read all task files in this batch to get their current state
2. Update `session-learnings.md` — mark batch as in-progress

#### Case A: Single-Task Batch (no worktree needed)

Spawn a **general-purpose agent** (`model: [assigned]`) with the task prompt (see Step 2.2).

#### Case B: Multi-Task Batch (parallel with worktrees)

Spawn **all agents simultaneously in a single message** using `isolation: "worktree"`:

```
Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose", model: "sonnet", isolation: "worktree", prompt: "...task1...")
Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose", model: "haiku", isolation: "worktree", prompt: "...task2...")
```

**Worktree agent rules:** Isolated branch from HEAD, cannot see other agents' changes, must NOT modify `session-learnings.md` or install dependencies.

### Step 2.2: Task Agent Prompt Template

> You are a Task Executor. Your job is to complete all pending items in the task file:
> `[FULL_PATH_TO_TASK_FILE]`
>
> **Rules:**
> 1. Read the task file first. Identify all `- [ ]` items.
> 2. Work through items **in order**, top to bottom.
> 3. For each item:
>    a. Locate the relevant code
>    b. Implement the fix/feature (follow TDD if writing new code: tests first, then implementation)
>    c. Use `Edit` tool to change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in the task file IMMEDIATELY after completing each item
>    d. Never batch checkbox updates — one at a time
> 4. If you encounter an error or blocker:
>    a. Log it in the task file under a `## Issues` section
>    b. Attempt to fix it. If the fix requires architectural changes, note it and move to the next item.
> 5. After completing all items, run these verification commands and report results:
>    - `pnpm turbo build` (zero errors)
>    - `pnpm exec biome check .` (zero lint issues)
>    - `pnpm turbo check-types` (zero type errors)
> 6. Return a structured summary:
>    - Items completed (count and list)
>    - Items failed (count and list with reasons)
>    - Errors encountered
>    - Files modified (full paths)
>    - Build/lint/type check results (pass/fail)
>
> **Standards:**
> - Use `pnpm` exclusively — never `npm` or `npx`
> - Kill processes before starting: `pkill -f "next-server|next start|next dev" 2>/dev/null`
> - Follow mobile-first order for UI changes
> - Zero console errors in final result
> - Add concise comments to any non-obvious logic you write (explain WHY, not WHAT)
>
> **Learnings from previous tasks in this session:**
> [PASTE RELEVANT RULES FROM session-learnings.md HERE]
>
> **Known patterns (from patterns.md):**
> [PASTE RELEVANT PATTERNS — e.g., .env.local usage, port conflicts, CWD requirements]

### Step 2.3: Post-Batch Merge

Follow the **Merge Protocol** from CLAUDE.md. Then:

1. Read each task file to verify checkboxes were updated
2. Update `session-learnings.md` (completed tasks, merge log, errors, agent performance)
3. **Feed forward:** Extract rules from `session-learnings.md` to include in the NEXT batch's agent prompts

### Step 2.4: Inter-Batch Learning Loop

Before spawning the next batch:

1. Re-read `session-learnings.md` to get accumulated knowledge
2. Include relevant `## Rules for Next Iteration` in each agent's prompt
3. If a previous batch had merge conflicts, add a rule about the conflicting area

This creates a **batch learning chain**: Batch 1's mistakes become Batch 2's rules, etc.

---

## Phase 2.5: Post-Implementation Simplification

After all batches complete (and merge, if parallel), invoke the `/simplify` skill to review the changed code for reuse, quality, and efficiency. Fix any issues it finds before proceeding to verification.

---

## Phase 3: Local Verification

After ALL batches are processed:

### Step 3.1: Spawn Verification Agent

Spawn a **general-purpose agent** (`model: "sonnet"`) for comprehensive verification:

> You are a Verification Agent. All task files have been implemented. Independently verify the work.
>
> **Step A: Build & Test Suite**
> Run and report: `pkill` servers → `pnpm turbo build` → `pnpm turbo test` → `pnpm exec biome check .` → `pnpm turbo check-types`. Fix issues and re-run until clean.
>
> **Step B: Local E2E Tests**
> Run Playwright E2E tests locally:
> ```bash
> pkill -f playwright 2>/dev/null
> pnpm exec playwright test
> ```
> If tests fail, fix and re-run until clean.
>
> **Step C: Task File Audit**
> Read each task file: [LIST ALL TASK FILES]. Verify all `- [ ]` → `- [x]`, no silently skipped items.
>
> **Step D: Regression Scan**
> Search for: unused imports, console.log/debug code, unresolved TODO/FIXME.
>
> Return a structured report: pass/fail per command, E2E results, task file audit results, regression findings.

### Step 3.2: Handle Local Verification Failures

1. Log failures in `session-learnings.md`
2. Assign fix agent model per CLAUDE.md matrix (lint → haiku, build → sonnet, logic → opus)
3. Spawn fix agents sequentially, re-verify, repeat until clean

### Step 3.3: Visual Verification (if UI changes were made)

Invoke the `check-and-fix-tasks` skill for Playwright verification and user confirmation.

### Step 3.4: Code Simplification (Optional — Run First on Large Tasks)

Before implementing new features on complex codebases, simplify the affected code first. Simpler code = fewer bugs, easier maintenance, easier to read.

Invoke the `/simplify` skill. It will review the changed/affected code for reuse, quality, and efficiency, then fix any issues found automatically.

### Step 3.5: Dev Server Smoke Test

Start the dev server and verify no server-side errors:

```bash
pkill -f "next-server|next start|next dev" 2>/dev/null
pnpm turbo dev
```

Check for console errors, hydration mismatches, and runtime exceptions. This is the user's signal that the code is ready for manual testing.

**After Phase 3 completes, tell the user:**

> "All local verification passed. The dev server is running — test the features manually. When you're satisfied, run `/ship-test-ensure` to commit, deploy, and verify in production."

---

## Phase 5: Learning & Self-Improvement

Follow the **Self-Improvement Protocol** from CLAUDE.md, plus:

### Step 5.1: Persist New Knowledge

For every issue encountered during the session — especially things that:
- Required multiple attempts to fix
- Revealed a pattern that wasn't in `patterns.md`
- Were caused by test flakiness or environment issues

**Add them to `patterns.md`** immediately with:
- What was tried and failed
- What the actual solution was
- A rule to follow next time

### Step 5.2: Session Report

```
## Build Complete

### Work Summary
- Task files processed: N
- Total items completed: M
- Items failed/skipped: X
- Parallel batches executed: B (N tasks parallelized)

### Parallelism Report
- Tasks run in parallel: N (across B batches via worktrees)
- Tasks run sequentially: M
- Merge conflicts encountered: X (resolved: Y)

### Model Usage
- haiku: N tasks (discovery, simple fixes, analysis)
- sonnet: M tasks (standard implementation, verification)
- opus: X tasks (complex refactoring, conflict resolution)

### Files Modified
- `path/to/file.ts` (+N/-M lines)

### Verification Results
- Local Build: PASS/FAIL
- Local Tests: PASS/FAIL (N passing, M failing)
- Local Lint: PASS/FAIL
- Local Types: PASS/FAIL
- Local E2E: PASS/FAIL

### New Knowledge Persisted
- [List of new entries added to patterns.md]

### Task Files
- `path/to/task1.md` — COMPLETED (batch 1, parallel, sonnet)
- `path/to/task2.md` — COMPLETED (batch 1, parallel, haiku)

### Next Step
Run `/ship-test-ensure` when ready to deploy.
```

---

## Compact Recovery Protocol

If `/compact` is called at any point:

1. **Immediately re-read** `session-learnings.md` — queue, batches, errors, rules, progress, merge log
2. **Re-read** `patterns.md` — accumulated knowledge and troubleshooting patterns
3. Read the task file(s) currently in-progress (from `## Active Task Queue`)
4. Check `## Parallel Batch Plan` and `## Worktree Merge Log` for batch state
5. **Resume from where you left off** — do NOT restart from Phase 1
6. If a parallel batch was interrupted, re-run only incomplete agents
7. If a merge was interrupted, continue from the merge log

---

## Standards (skill-specific, in addition to CLAUDE.md)

- All Playwright verification uses Chromium only
- Screenshots saved to `./screenshots/[task-name]/`
- Task file must always reflect actual progress — never stale
- Session learnings file must be updated after EVERY significant event (batch, merge, verification)
- Each batch inherits rules from all previous batches in the session
- **ALWAYS persist new knowledge** to `patterns.md` when something fails and gets fixed
- **NO commits, deploys, or staging** — this skill is local-only
- After local verification, tell the user to test manually then run `/ship-test-ensure`
- Add concise comments to non-obvious code (explain WHY, not WHAT)
- Environment files: use `.env.local` (never `.env.staging` or `.env.production`)
