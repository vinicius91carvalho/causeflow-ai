## WI-AC-001 — Verify-first (foundation)

**Result: implementation=true**

Boundary exercised against the running docker-compose stack (real HTTP/CLI, no mocks).

- `docker compose up -d ministack redis postgres langfuse hindsight` → ministack, redis, langfuse, hindsight all `(healthy)` within ~23s (< 60s).
- `curl http://localhost:4566/_ministack/health` → 200.
- `awslocal dynamodb list-tables` → `causeflow` table present.
- `awslocal sqs list-queues` → 8 URLs (alerts, investigation, remediation, progress + 4 DLQs).
- `awslocal kms list-aliases` → `alias/causeflow-token-encryption`.

### Root-cause fixes (smallest diff, `core/docker-compose.yml` only)

The existing code failed AC-001 in three independent ways; each was fixed at its root cause with no refactor:

1. **Init script never ran** — ministack's `/etc/localstack/init/ready.d` was empty. Mounted `./infra/localstack/init` there so `01-create-resources.sh` + `02-ecs-ecr.sh` auto-run on ready (table/queues/KMS alias now created).
2. **ministack/redis/postgres/langfuse never reported healthy** — (a) ministack image has no `curl`; switched its healthcheck to `python3` urllib. (b) redis/postgres had no healthcheck; added `redis-cli ping` and `pg_isready`. (c) langfuse raced postgres (Prisma P1001); made it `depends_on: postgres: condition: service_healthy`. (d) langfuse Next.js bound only to the container IP and busybox `wget` resolves `localhost` to IPv6 `::1` first (refused); set `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` and pointed the healthcheck at `127.0.0.1`.
3. **hindsight crashed on boot** — `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY` defaulted to empty (MemoryEngine requires non-empty); defaulted to a dev placeholder so the container boots and `/health` passes. A real key still wins via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

## QA pass — AC-001 (independent re-test)

**Result: qa=true, implementation=true**

Re-ran independently against the running stack in the isolated worktree.

- `docker compose stop` then `up -d ministack redis postgres langfuse hindsight` → all four reported `(healthy)` within **16s** (< 60s).
- `curl http://localhost:4566/_ministack/health` → **200**.
- `awslocal dynamodb list-tables` → `causeflow` present (3 GSIs).
- `awslocal sqs list-queues` → **8 URLs** (alerts, investigation, remediation, progress + 4 DLQs).
- `awslocal kms list-aliases` → `alias/causeflow-token-encryption`.
- Init script `infra/localstack/init/01-create-resources.sh` mounted at `/etc/localstack/init/ready.d` and ran on ministack ready.

No defects found within the AC-001 boundary. (PITR is DISABLED but that is AC-005's concern, not AC-001.)

### Out of scope

The full literal `docker compose up -d` (all services) still errors on missing `./samples/*` customer-app build contexts. Those samples belong to later relay/customer-VPC/e2e work items (not the foundation context); AC-001's explicit boundary is the four infra containers + init resources + health curl, all of which pass. Not addressed here per the no-restructure rule.

- `awslocal kms list-aliases` → `alias/causeflow-token-encryption`.
- Init script `infra/localstack/init/01-create-resources.sh` mounted and ran on ministack ready.

No defects within the AC-001 boundary. integration=true set for WI-AC-001.

## WI-AC-002 — Verify-first (foundation)

**Result: implementation=true**

Boundary exercised against the running docker-compose stack (real HTTP on the assigned PORT=5170, no mocks).

- `pnpm install` ran (node_modules was absent in the worktree).
- Created local `.env.dev` (gitignored) pointing at ministack (:4566) + redis (:6379) with `PORT=5170`, `DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=causeflow`, the 4 SQS queue URLs, and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` (empty → anthropic check skipped).
- `pnpm dev` → Hono API listening on PORT=5170. Boot latency: "Starting CauseFlow" → "CauseFlow is running" ≈ 55ms (tsx/pnpm load adds ~1–2s); first `curl http://localhost:5170/health` → **200** well within 10s.
- `curl http://localhost:5170/health` → `200` body:
  `{"status":"ok","service":"causeflow","version":"0.1.0","commit":"unknown","timestamp":"...","checks":{"dynamodb":"ok","redis":"ok","sqs":"ok","anthropic":"ok"}}`
  — lists `{dynamodb: ok, redis: ok, sqs: ok, anthropic: ok}`; anthropic reports `ok` (skipped) because no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is configured.
- `pnpm test:run` → 161 files / 1053 tests pass (incl. updated I5 `/health` shape test).
- `pnpm typecheck` → clean. `pnpm lint-invariants` → 9 passed, 0 failed.

### Root-cause fixes (smallest diff, 5 tracked files)

The existing code failed AC-002 at the boundary in two independent ways; each fixed at its root cause with no refactor:

1. **`/health` body did not list per-service statuses** — it returned only the Sprint-3 5-key shape `{status, service, version, commit, timestamp}`. AC-002 requires the body to list `{dynamodb, redis, sqs, anthropic}`. Added an additive `checks` map (name → status) to the `/health` response in `src/app.ts`, derived from the existing `HealthChecker.runAll()` results. Reconciled the now-contradictory I5 invariant (exactly-5-keys) by adding `checks` to the allowed top-level keys in `INVARIANTS.md` and `tests/src/app.test.ts`. The deploy-script `HealthResponse`/`check-health` only asserts `commit`, so the additive field is safe.
2. **Anthropic check was never registered** — `bootstrap.ts` only registered DynamoDB/Redis/SQS, so `anthropic` never appeared in health output. Registered `new AnthropicHealthCheck(new CircuitBreaker())` in `bootstrap.ts`, and made `AnthropicHealthCheck.check()` return `ok` (skipped, `details.skipped=true`) when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is empty — directly implementing "Anthropic check is skipped when no key is configured".

No refactor/restructure of working code. `.env.dev` and `node_modules` are local untracked scaffold setup (gitignored), not code changes.

### Out of scope

AC-002's literal text says `curl http://localhost:3099/health` (default 3099); the harness assigned PORT=5170, so the boundary was exercised on 5170 per the "bring up the app on the assigned ports" instruction. The config default remains 3000 (config wins); the "default 3099" wording in the spec is a doc drift not addressed here per the no-restructure rule — the AC's actual boundary (Hono listens on PORT within 10s + /health 200 with the four-service body) passes on the assigned port.

## QA pass — AC-002 (independent re-test)

**Result: qa=true, implementation=true**

Re-ran independently against the running stack in the isolated worktree (real HTTP on PORT=5170).

- Killed the prior `tsx watch` instance; started a fresh `pnpm dev` (uses `.env.dev` with `PORT=5170`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` empty).
- Hono API listening on PORT=5170 within **~3.3s** (well under 10s). Log: `CauseFlow is running` / `port: 5170`.
- `curl http://localhost:5170/health` → **HTTP 200** in ~17ms.
- Body: `{"status":"ok","service":"causeflow","version":"0.1.0","commit":"unknown","timestamp":"...","checks":{"dynamodb":"ok","redis":"ok","sqs":"ok","anthropic":"ok"}}` — lists exactly `{dynamodb: ok, redis: ok, sqs: ok, anthropic: ok}`.
- Anthropic check returns `ok` (skipped) because `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is empty (verified `anthropic-check.ts` returns `details.skipped=true`).
- Dependencies healthy: ministack :4566, redis :6379 both up (DynamoDB/Redis/SQS checks `ok` backed by real services).

No defects found within the AC-002 boundary. PORT=5170 used per harness assignment (spec's "default 3099" wording is the same doc drift noted in the verify-first pass; the AC boundary — Hono listens on the assigned PORT within 10s and /health returns 200 with the four-service body — passes).

## 2026-07-07 — Integrated Verification (AC-002)

**Result: integration=true, implementation=true, qa=true**

Re-verified against integrated main (commit 3181d08, branch `main`) on PORT=5170.

- Killed the prior isolated-worktree (`gen/core-foundation`) `tsx watch` holding 5170; created a local `.env.dev` (gitignored) pointing at ministack (:4566) + redis (:6379), `PORT=5170`, `DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=causeflow`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` (empty → anthropic skipped).
- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` → node_modules restored (playwright chromium postinstall fails on ubuntu26.04 but is an optional dev dep; tsx present).
- Fresh `pnpm dev` (from this main worktree) → Hono API listening on 5170. Boot latency: "Starting CauseFlow" 20:10:09.470 → "CauseFlow is running" 20:10:09.521 (~51ms; tsx/pnpm load adds ~1–2s) — well within 10s.
- `curl http://localhost:5170/health` → **HTTP 200**, `content-type: application/json`, body:
  `{"status":"ok","service":"causeflow","version":"0.1.0","commit":"unknown","timestamp":"...","checks":{"dynamodb":"ok","redis":"ok","sqs":"ok","anthropic":"ok"}}` — lists exactly `{dynamodb: ok, redis: ok, sqs: ok, anthropic: ok}`.
- Anthropic check reports `ok` (skipped) because `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is empty; DynamoDB/Redis/SQS checks `ok` backed by the real ministack + redis containers (all `(healthy)`).
- Smoke: `GET /dashboard` → 200 `text/html`; auth-gated `/api/v1/whoami` → 401 (no bearer) — app is genuinely serving HTTP.

No defects within the AC-002 boundary. integration=true set for WI-AC-002. PORT=5170 used per harness assignment (spec's "default 3099" is the known doc drift; the AC boundary — Hono listens on the assigned PORT within 10s and /health returns 200 with the four-service body — passes on main).

## WI-AC-003 — Verify-first (foundation)

**Result: implementation=true**

Boundary exercised against the running app (real HTTP on the assigned PORT=5174, no mocks). Stack: `docker compose up -d ministack redis` (both `(healthy)`), `pnpm dev` → `CauseFlow is running` on 5174.

- `curl http://localhost:5174/dashboard` → **HTTP 200**, `content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`, 146078 bytes.
  - Alpine.js present (`alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js`), Tailwind present (`cdn.tailwindcss.com`), `x-data` root elements present (12). ✓
- `curl http://localhost:5174/widget/widget.js` → **HTTP 200**, `content-type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8`, 38037 bytes — the Vite-built widget IIFE bundle (`var CauseflowWidget=(function(c){...}`). ✓
- Regression smoke: `/health` → 200; auth-gated `/v1/audit` → 401 (auth still enforced for non-public routes).
- `pnpm typecheck` → clean. `pnpm lint-invariants` → 9 passed, 0 failed. `pnpm test:run` → 161 files / 1053 tests pass. `pnpm lint` → 0 errors (112 pre-existing `any` warnings, none new).

### Root-cause fixes (smallest diff, 4 tracked files)

The existing code failed AC-003 at the widget boundary only (dashboard already passed):

1. **No `/widget/widget.js` route served** — the spec requires the widget bundle at `GET /widget/widget.js`, but `src/app.ts` had no such route and the global auth middleware returned 401 for it. Added a public route `app.get('/widget/widget.js', ...)` in `src/app.ts` that serves the Vite-built bundle from `packages/widget/dist/widget.js` with `Content-Type: application/javascript`. Returns 404 with a build hint if the dist is absent.
2. **Widget bundle not built / wrong filename** — `packages/widget/vite.config.ts` emitted `causeflow-widget.js` and used `minify: 'terser'` (terser is not installed → build failed). Changed `fileName` to `widget.js` (matches the AC URL + portal-shell reference) and `minify` to `'esbuild'` (bundled, no extra dep). `pnpm --filter @causeflow/widget build` now produces `dist/widget.js`.
3. **`/widget/` not in public-path allow-lists** — auth + tenant middleware would still reject the unauthenticated bundle request. Added `'/widget/'` to `PUBLIC_PATHS` in `auth.middleware.ts` and to the skip-list in `tenant.middleware.ts` (mirroring the existing `/v1/widget/` and `/portal` entries).

No refactor/restructure of working code. Local untracked setup (gitignored, like `.env.dev`/`node_modules` in WI-AC-002): `pnpm install`, `cd packages/widget && pnpm install && pnpm build` (produces gitignored `packages/widget/dist/widget.js`). PORT=5174 used per harness assignment (spec's literal `:3099` is the known doc drift noted in WI-AC-002; the AC boundary — `/dashboard` HTML + `/widget/widget.js` JS bundle — passes on the assigned port).

### Out of scope

Wiring the widget build into the root `pnpm dev` script was deliberately NOT done: the widget is a standalone package (no pnpm-workspace.yaml) with its own lockfile, and a `predev` hook that depends on `packages/widget/node_modules` would regress AC-002's plain `pnpm dev` flow in a fresh checkout. Building the bundle is local setup, consistent with the WI-AC-002 `.env.dev`/`node_modules` pattern. A future work item can promote the widget to a workspace member if reproducible dev-time builds are required.

## QA pass — AC-003 (independent re-test)

**Result: qa=true, implementation=true**

Re-ran independently against the running app in the isolated worktree (real HTTP on PORT=5174). Stack already up: `tsx watch --env-file=.env.dev src/main.ts` (pid 1207555) listening on 5174; ministack :4566 + redis :6379 `(healthy)`.

- `curl http://localhost:5174/dashboard` → **HTTP 200**, `content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`, 146078 bytes.
  - Tailwind present (`https://cdn.tailwindcss.com`), Alpine.js present (`alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js`), `x-data` root element present (12 occurrences incl. body root `x-data="dashboard()"`). ✓
- `curl http://localhost:5174/widget/widget.js` → **HTTP 200**, `content-type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8`, 38037 bytes — Vite-built widget IIFE bundle (`var CauseflowWidget=(function(c){...})`). ✓
- Route wiring verified in `src/app.ts`: `app.get('/dashboard', ...)` serves `dashboard/index.html`; `app.get('/widget/widget.js', ...)` serves `packages/widget/dist/widget.js` with `Content-Type: application/javascript`. `/dashboard` + `/widget/` in auth + tenant public-path allow-lists.
- Regression smoke: `/health` → 200 json `{dynamodb,redis,sqs,anthropic}: ok`.

No defects within the AC-003 boundary. PORT=5174 used per harness assignment (spec's literal `:3099` is the known doc drift noted in WI-AC-002; the AC boundary — `/dashboard` returns Alpine+Tailwind+x-data HTML and `/widget/widget.js` returns the Vite bundle as `application/javascript` — passes on the assigned port).

Note (out of scope, not a defect): the separate dockerized `core-causeflow-api-1` container on :3099 returns 500 for `/dashboard` and 401 for `/widget/widget.js` — it runs a stale `node dist/main.js` image predating the AC-003 route fixes and is not the surface under test in this isolated worktree (PORT=5174 dev server is).

## WI-AC-004 — Verify-first (foundation)

**Result: implementation=true**

Boundary exercised at the real CLI boundary (`pnpm lint-invariants` → `infra/scripts/check-invariants.ts`); app also brought up on assigned PORT=5174, `curl /health` → 200 (smoke only; AC-004 boundary is the lint command, not HTTP).

- `pnpm lint-invariants` (baseline) → **exit 0**. `10 passed, 0 failed` (I1–I4, I6–I11; I5 skipped).
- Manually introduced a forbidden cross-module direct function call (`src/modules/triage/infra/_probe.ts` doing `import { CreateTenantUseCase } from '@modules/tenant/application/...'` and a relative `import { IngestAlertUseCase } from '../../ingestion/application/...'`), re-ran `pnpm lint-invariants` → **exit 1**, `9 passed, 1 failed` with a specific I11 violation message:
  `FAIL I11 — No cross-module direct function calls (no value imports from another module's application/)` listing each offending file + module pair. Probe file removed afterwards.
- Regression: `pnpm typecheck` → clean; `pnpm test:run` → 161 files / 1053 tests pass; `pnpm lint-invariants` baseline green after the fix.

### Root-cause fix (smallest diff, 2 tracked files)

The existing code failed AC-004 clause 2 only (clause 1 already passed): `check-invariants.ts` had **no check for cross-module direct function calls**, so introducing one did not fail the command. CLAUDE.md already states `pnpm lint-invariants` enforces I1–I11 incl. "no cross-module direct calls", but the checker never implemented it.

1. **Added `checkI11()` to `infra/scripts/check-invariants.ts`** — walks `src/modules/**/*.ts`, parses imports, and fails on any non-type-only (value) import whose target resolves into another module's `application/` (both `@modules/<mod>/application/...` and relative `../../<mod>/application/...` forms). Type-only imports (`import type ...`, or named bindings whose every binding carries the inline `type` modifier) remain allowed — they emit no runtime call and are used for DI typing (the existing baseline has several such cross-module `import type` use-case imports). Scoped to `application/` (use cases / DTOs) so the existing grandfathered cross-module infra value imports (`LOG_TOOLS`/`clerkGetUserList`) and domain error-class imports do not regress the baseline.
2. **`INVARIANTS.md`** — documented the new statically-enforced `I11 — No cross-module direct function calls`; renumbered the pre-existing runtime contract "Inconclusive outcome is persisted and emitted" from I11 → I12 (it was already verified by integration test, never by `lint-invariants`, and no code references the I11 number).

No refactor/restructure of working code. Baseline `lint-invariants` stays at exit 0; the AC's violation scenario now exits non-zero with a specific I11 message.

## 2026-07-07T23:51Z — Integrated Verification (AC-004)

- Result: integration=true, implementation=true, qa=true

Probe removed; baseline green again.

- Baseline `pnpm lint-invariants` → **exit 0** (`10 passed, 0 failed`; I1–I4 PASS, I5 SKIP, I6–I11 PASS).
- Introduced a cross-module direct function call by editing `src/modules/audit/infra/clerk-user-email-resolver.ts` to add `import { GetTenantUseCase } from '@modules/tenant/application/get-tenant.usecase.js'`; re-ran `pnpm lint-invariants` → **exit 1**, `9 passed, 1 failed`, specific message: `FAIL I11 — No cross-module direct function calls (no value imports from another module's application/)` → `src/modules/audit/infra/clerk-user-email-resolver.ts — module 'audit' value-imports from module 'tenant' application/ ("@modules/tenant/application/get-tenant.usecase.js")`. Probe reverted; baseline re-verified green (exit 0).

## WI-AC-005 — Verify-first (foundation)

**Result: implementation=true**

Boundary exercised against the running docker-compose stack (real DynamoDB API on ministack :4566, no mocks). AC-005 depends_on AC-002; the foundation-mode Hono API was already up on the assigned PORT=5174 (`/health` → 200, `checks.dynamodb=ok`).

Verified at the real DynamoDB boundary on `http://localhost:4566` (host has no `aws` binary; `awslocal` inside the ministack container calls the identical `localhost:4566` ministack service, mapped to host `0.0.0.0:4566->4566`):

- `dynamodb list-tables` → includes `causeflow-local`.
- `dynamodb describe-table --table-name causeflow-local` → `GlobalSecondaryIndexes` = `[gsi1, gsi2, gsi3]` (count **3**).
- `dynamodb describe-continuous-backups --table-name causeflow-local` → `PointInTimeRecoveryDescription.PointInTimeRecoveryStatus = ENABLED`.

### Root-cause fixes (smallest diff, 4 tracked files)

The existing code failed AC-005 at the boundary in two independent ways; each fixed at its root cause with no refactor:

1. **Table was named `causeflow`, not `causeflow-local`** — AC-005 explicitly and repeatedly requires the local table named `causeflow-local` in `list-tables`. The init script, config default, and env files all used `causeflow`. Renamed the canonical local table to `causeflow-local` consistently in `infra/localstack/init/01-create-resources.sh` (TABLE_NAME), `src/shared/config/index.ts` (default), `.env.example`, `.env.localstack`. Zero blast radius on the running `causeflow-api` container (it uses Postgres via `DATABASE_URL`, not DynamoDB). Other `'causeflow'` string literals in `src/` are ElectroDB `model.service` attributes / JWT issuer, not the table name — correctly left untouched.
2. **PITR was DISABLED** — the init script created the table but never enabled Point-in-Time Recovery. Added an `awslocal dynamodb update-continuous-backups --point-in-time-recovery-specification PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled=true` step to `01-create-resources.sh` right after table creation (idempotent). Verified it flips the status to ENABLED on ministack.

### Regression checks

- `pnpm typecheck` → clean.
- `pnpm lint-invariants` → 10 passed, 0 failed (I1–I11).
- `pnpm test:run` → 161 files / 1053 tests pass.
- Foundation app on PORT=5174 still boots; `/health` → `checks.dynamodb=ok` (describes `causeflow-local`).

### Notes

- The host has no `aws` CLI installed; the AC's literal `aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 ...` was exercised via `docker exec core-ministack-1 awslocal ...`, which issues real DynamoDB API calls against the same `http://localhost:4566` ministack service (docker-mapped to host :4566). Same real external boundary.
- `describe-table` does not return `PointInTimeRecoveryDescription` in real DynamoDB (that lives on `describe-continuous-backups`); the AC's CLI wording is descriptive. Both calls were issued and both confirm the required state.
- The legacy `causeflow` table (created by the prior init run during AC-001) still exists on ministack; it is harmless and not referenced by app config. Not deleted per the no-restructure rule.

## 2026-07-08T00:29Z — Independent QA re-audit (WI-AC-005)

- Agent: qa-agent (isolated worktree).
- Boundary exercised: real DynamoDB API on `http://localhost:4566` (ministack container `core-ministack-1` `(healthy)`, host port `0.0.0.0:4566->4566`). Host has no `aws` binary, so the AC's literal `aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 ...` was run via `docker exec core-ministack-1 aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 ...` with `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1` + dummy creds — same real ministack endpoint.
- `dynamodb list-tables` → `TableNames: ["causeflow", "causeflow-local"]` — **includes `causeflow-local`**. ✓
- `dynamodb describe-table --table-name causeflow-local` → `TableStatus: ACTIVE`, `GlobalSecondaryIndexes: [gsi1, gsi2, gsi3]` (grep `"IndexName"` count = **3**, all `IndexStatus: ACTIVE`). ✓
- `dynamodb describe-continuous-backups --table-name causeflow-local` → `PointInTimeRecoveryDescription.PointInTimeRecoveryStatus = ENABLED` (plus `ContinuousBackupsStatus: ENABLED`). ✓ (In real DynamoDB `describe-table` itself never returns `PointInTimeRecoveryDescription`; the AC's wording is descriptive — both calls confirm the required state.)
- Smoke: foundation API on assigned PORT=5174 → `curl http://localhost:5174/health` → HTTP 200, `checks.dynamodb=ok` (the app describes `causeflow-local`).
- Verdict: qa=true, implementation=true, no defects within AC-005 boundary.

- Attempt: 1/3
- WorkItem: WI-AC-005
- DefectReport: Integrated Verification failed
- RepairPlan: AC-005's DynamoDB boundary is genuinely satisfied (causeflow-local exists, 3 GSIs, PITR ENABLED) and the fix is merged to main (cd5d57e). The Integrated Verification failure is operational, not a content defect: the direct-host integration verifier runs the AC's literal `aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 ...` on the host, but the host has no `aws` CLI installed. The isolated QA bypassed this via `docker exec core-ministack-1 aws ...`; the integration step did not, so it failed before evaluating the AC. A secondary risk is the AC's wording that `describe-table` shows PointInTimeRecoveryDescription — in real DynamoDB that field is only on `describe-continuous-backups`.; Do NOT change application or init-script code — the AC boundary is already satisfied and merged to main.; Make the Integrated Verification exercise the same real boundary the isolated QA used: run the AWS calls inside the ministack container, e.g. `docker exec -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 core-ministack-1 aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 dynamodb list-tables` (and describe-table / describe-continuous-backups). This hits the identical :4566 service mapped to the host.; Alternatively install the `aws` CLI on the host (or provide a thin `aws` shim that proxies to the ministack container) so the AC's literal host command resolves.; For the PITR check, verify against `describe-continuous-backups` (where `PointInTimeRecoveryDescription.PointInTimeRecoveryStatus` actually lives), not `describe-table` — the AC's `describe-table` wording is descriptive; real DynamoDB never returns PITR from describe-table.; Re-run Integrated Verification for WI-AC-005 with the above invocation path; expect integration=true.

## 2026-07-07 — Integrated Verification (AC-005)

**Result: integration=true, implementation=true, defects=[]**

Re-verified against integrated main (commit aa8be4e, branch `gen/core-foundation`). Per the Repair Plan, no code changes — the AC boundary was already satisfied and merged at cd5d57e. The prior Integrated Verification failed operationally (host has no `aws` binary), so the real DynamoDB boundary was exercised via the same path the isolated QA used: `docker exec` into `core-ministack-1` against the identical host-mapped `:4566` service.

- `docker exec -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 core-ministack-1 aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 dynamodb list-tables --query TableNames --output json` → `["causeflow","causeflow-local"]` — includes `causeflow-local`. ✓
- `... dynamodb describe-table --table-name causeflow-local --query 'Table.GlobalSecondaryIndexes[*].IndexName' --output json` → `["gsi1","gsi2","gsi3"]`; `[IndexStatus]` all `ACTIVE`. ✓ (3 GSIs)
- `... dynamodb describe-continuous-backups --table-name causeflow-local --query 'ContinuousBackupsDescription.PointInTimeRecoveryDescription.PointInTimeRecoveryStatus' --output text` → `ENABLED`. ✓ (In real DynamoDB `PointInTimeRecoveryDescription` lives on `describe-continuous-backups`, not `describe-table`; the AC's `describe-table` wording is descriptive — both calls confirm the required state.)
- `curl http://localhost:5174/health` → **HTTP 200**, `checks.dynamodb=ok` (app describes `causeflow-local`).

Zero-diff to application/init-script code. Evidence log updated with `integration=true, implementation=true, defects=[]`.

- Attempt: independent re-audit
- WorkItem: WI-AC-005
- Result: qa=true, implementation=true, defects=[]

Verified the AC-005 DynamoDB boundary against the running `core-ministack-1` (endpoint http://localhost:4566, reachable from host):

- `list-tables` → `["causeflow","causeflow-local"]` — includes `causeflow-local`. ✓
- `describe-table --table-name causeflow-local` → `GlobalSecondaryIndexes[].IndexName = ["gsi1","gsi2","gsi3"]`, all `ACTIVE`. ✓ (3 GSIs)
- `describe-continuous-backups --table-name causeflow-local` → `PointInTimeRecoveryDescription.PointInTimeRecoveryStatus = ENABLED`. ✓ (PITR enabled; in real DynamoDB this field lives on `describe-continuous-backups`, the AC's `describe-table` wording is descriptive)
- `curl http://localhost:5174/health` → HTTP 200, `checks.dynamodb=ok`.

Note: host has no `aws` binary, so the AC's literal host command was exercised via `docker exec` into the ministack container against the identical host-mapped :4566 service. This is an environment tooling constraint, not an implementation defect — the init script (`infra/localstack/init/01-create-resources.sh`) creates the table with 3 GSIs and enables PITR, and the table is present and correctly configured.

Verified the DynamoDB boundary against the running `core-ministack-1` (endpoint http://localhost:4566, reachable from host). Host has no `aws` CLI, so the AC's literal command was exercised both via `docker exec ... awslocal` and via the host-side AWS SDK v3 (`@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb`) pointed at http://localhost:4566 — identical boundary.

- list-tables → includes `causeflow-local`. ✓
- describe-table --table-name causeflow-local → 3 GlobalSecondaryIndexes: gsi1, gsi2, gsi3 (all ACTIVE); TableStatus ACTIVE. ✓
- describe-continuous-backups --table-name causeflow-local → PointInTimeRecoveryDescription.PointInTimeRecoveryStatus = ENABLED. ✓ (In real DynamoDB PITR lives on `describe-continuous-backups`; the AC's `describe-table` wording is descriptive — both calls confirm the required state.)

- Outcome: passed; implementation=true (after minimal fix)

Verified the SQS + KMS boundary against the running `core-ministack-1` (endpoint http://localhost:4566, reachable from host). Host has no `aws` CLI, so the AC's literal commands were exercised via `docker exec core-ministack-1 awslocal ...` against the identical host-mapped :4566 service.

- `sqs list-queues` → 8 URLs: causeflow-alerts, causeflow-alerts-dlq, causeflow-triage, causeflow-triage-dlq, causeflow-investigation, causeflow-investigation-dlq, causeflow-remediation, causeflow-remediation-dlq. ✓ (alerts / triage / investigation / remediation + 4 DLQs)
- `kms list-aliases` → alias `alias/causeflow-token-encryption` present. ✓

Defect found + root-cause fix (smallest diff): the init script `infra/localstack/init/01-create-resources.sh` created a `causeflow-progress` (+dlq) queue instead of the `causeflow-triage` (+dlq) queue required by AC-006 and referenced by `.env.dev` (`SQS_TRIAGE_QUEUE_URL`). The `progress` queue was unused in dev (`.env.dev` sets no `SQS_PROGRESS_QUEUE_URL`, so the progress consumer was already disabled). Renamed the queue block progress→triage in the init script and re-ran it against the live ministack (deleted the two progress queues first). No application code changed.
