## 2026-07-08T16:22:10.512Z — Explicit Resume

- WorkItem: WI-AC-028
- Outcome: user authorized a new Attempt cycle
- Guidance: Confirmed via the log-detail fix: this block was pure OpenRouter 429 rate-limit exhaustion on qwen3-coder:free (8 req/min), not a real coding/QA defect -- the Work Item was never actually attempted. Also fixed the root cause (orchestrator now backs off before retrying after a 429 instead of instantly re-exhausting the same limit). Retry.
- NextAction: Coding Attempt 1

## 2026-07-08T16:43:18.477Z — Explicit Resume

- WorkItem: WI-AC-028
- Outcome: user authorized a new Attempt cycle
- Guidance: Confirmed pure OpenRouter 429 rate-limit exhaustion again, not a real defect. Root-caused the persistent contention: openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder:free's 8 req/min limit is shared across the whole account and further saturated by external OpenRouter demand -- even with backoff+jitter, 4 concurrent subprojects kept exhausting it. Switched the pi adapter to NVIDIA NIM's deepseek-v4-pro (separate unshared quota pool, 40 req/min, verified reachable). Retry.
- NextAction: Coding Attempt 1

## 2026-07-08T16:43:20.037Z — Blocked Work Item

- Attempt: 1/3
- WorkItem: WI-AC-028
- Outcome: coding agent failed three times
- Defects: Error: Model "nvidia-nim/deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-pro" not found. Use --list-models to see available models.
- NextAction: User reviews evidence and explicitly resumes with guidance

## 2026-07-08T20:09:18.732Z — Explicit Resume

- WorkItem: WI-AC-028
- Outcome: user authorized a new Attempt cycle
- Guidance: This block was a real bug in my own config, not a code defect: the previous pi adapter switch referenced a made-up provider key (nvidia-nim) in models.json that pi never actually recognized -- it needed either an explicit 'api' field (unrecognized custom provider) or credentials in ~/.pi/agent/auth.json under pi's real native provider key, neither of which was done. Fixed: credentials now in auth.json under the correct native keys (nvidia, opencode-go), and the adapter points at opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash (much higher throughput ceiling, verified working end-to-end via a direct pi invocation before this retry). Retry.
- NextAction: Coding Attempt 1

## 2026-07-08T20:22:00.000Z — Implemented

- WorkItem: WI-AC-028
- Outcome: All AC-028 endpoints verified against HTTP boundary on port 5184.
- Changes:
  - Added local JWT support to auth middleware (dev/OSS mode)
  - Added `/v1/auth/oss-login` endpoint for local JWT issuance
  - Created `ServiceEdge` domain entity
  - Added `upsertServiceEdge`, `listServiceEdges`, `search` to `ICodeKnowledgeRepository`
  - Implemented DynamoDB-backed `search()` with PatternEntity confidence ranking
  - Added `POST /v1/code-knowledge/repos` — accepts repoUrl+credentials, calls IndexRepositoryUseCase
  - Added `GET /v1/code-knowledge/search?q=...` — returns repos matched by keyword, ranked by PatternEntity confidence
  - Added `GET /v1/code-knowledge/edges` — lists service edges
  - Updated IndexRepositoryUseCase to write ServiceEdgeEntity on index
  - Wired `indexRepository` through bootstrap into `CodeKnowledgeUseCases`
- Tests:
  - POST /repos with valid payload → 200 `{"status":"indexed","repoFullName":"..."}`
  - GET /search?q=retry → 200 `{"query":"retry","results":[]}`
  - GET /search without q → 400
  - Unauthenticated → 401
  - Health check → 200 with all services ok
- NextAction: commit
