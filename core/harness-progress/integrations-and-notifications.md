- Defects: 429: {"message":"Provider returned error","code":429,"metadata":{"raw":"qwen/qwen3-coder:free is temporarily rate-limited upstream.

## 2026-07-08T16:34:18.468Z — Explicit Resume

- WorkItem: WI-AC-030
- Outcome: user authorized a new Attempt cycle
- Guidance: Confirmed via the log-detail fix: this block was pure OpenRouter 429 rate-limit exhaustion on qwen3-coder:free (8 req/min), not a real coding/QA defect -- the Work Item was never actually attempted. Also fixed the root cause (orchestrator now backs off before retrying after a 429 instead of instantly re-exhausting the same limit). Retry.

## 2026-07-08T16:43:28.712Z — Explicit Resume

- WorkItem: WI-AC-030
- Outcome: user authorized a new Attempt cycle
- Guidance: Confirmed pure OpenRouter 429 rate-limit exhaustion again, not a real defect. Root-caused the persistent contention: openrouter/qwen/qwen3-coder:free's 8 req/min limit is shared across the whole account and further saturated by external OpenRouter demand -- even with backoff+jitter, 4 concurrent subprojects kept exhausting it. Switched the pi adapter to NVIDIA NIM's deepseek-v4-pro (separate unshared quota pool, 40 req/min, verified reachable). Retry.

## 2026-07-08T16:43:30.198Z — Blocked Work Item

- Attempt: 1/3

## 2026-07-08T21:08:11.301Z — Explicit Resume

- WorkItem: WI-AC-030
- Outcome: user authorized a new Attempt cycle
- Guidance: This block was a real bug in my own config, not a code defect: the previous pi adapter switch referenced a made-up provider key (nvidia-nim) in models.json that pi never actually recognized -- it needed either an explicit 'api' field (unrecognized custom provider) or credentials in ~/.pi/agent/auth.json under pi's real native provider key, neither of which was done. Fixed: credentials now in auth.json under the correct native keys (nvidia, opencode-go), and the adapter points at opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash (much higher throughput ceiling, verified working end-to-end via a direct pi invocation before this retry). Retry.

- Outcome: isolated QA passed

## 2026-07-08T21:48:00.000Z — Integrated Verification of WI-AC-030

- WorkItem: WI-AC-030
- Phase: integrated-verification
- Verdict: FAIL
- Defects:
  1. GET /config, PATCH /config, DELETE /oauth, POST /test return 500 because DynamoTenantRepository requires DynamoDB but OSS Postgres runtime provides no AWS credentials — Slack module not adapted for OSS.
  2. Bot token stored as plaintext in tenant settings.slackConfig.accessToken, not KMS-encrypted ciphertext in SlackOAuthStateEntity/SlackNotificationEntity as specified.
  3. POST /events acknowledges events with {ok: true} but does not trigger a downstream "chat reply" — no processing pipeline for incoming Slack events.
- Working endpoints: POST /install (200), POST /events url_verification (200), POST /events valid signature (200), POST /events tampered body (401), POST /events stale timestamp (401), GET /oauth/authorize (302), GET /oauth/callback (302).
- All 1057 unit tests pass (74 in integration module).

## 2026-07-08T22:01:57.399Z — Integrated Verification defect

- Attempt: 1/3
- WorkItem: WI-AC-030
- Defects: Integrated Verification of **WI-AC-030** complete.

**Verdict: FAIL** — 6 defects found.

**Working (all verified against live API at :3099):**
- `POST /install` (authed) → 200 with authUrl + state
- `POST /events` (url_verification) → 200 with challenge
- `POST /events` (valid Slack signature) → 200 `{"ok":true}`
- `POST /events` (tampered body) → 401 `{"error":"Invalid signature"}`
- `POST /events` (stale timestamp / missing headers) → 401
- `GET /oauth/authorize` → 302 redirect to Slack
- `GET /oauth/callback` (with error param) → 302 redirect to dashboard
- All 1057 unit tests pass (74 in integration module)

**Critical defect:**
1. **DynamoDB dependency in OSS runtime** — `GET /config`, `PATCH /config`, `DELETE /oauth`, `POST /test` all return **500** because `DynamoTenantRepository` requires DynamoDB, but the running API uses the OSS Postgres runtime where no AWS credentials are available. The `try/catch` pattern used in the install/events endpoints is not applied to the tenant-repo-dependent routes.

2. **Bot token stored as plaintext** — `ConnectSlackUseCase` stores `accessToken` directly into tenant settings without KMS/AES-GCM encryption, contradicting the "KMS-encrypted ciphertext" spec requirement.

3. **No chat reply on events** — The `/events` handler acknowledges incoming Slack events with `{ok: true}` but implements no downstream reply pipeline.

- RepairPlan: WI-AC-030 FAIL — 3 defects confirmed via source inspection. All routes, entities, and use cases exist in the repository; the scaffold matches the spec. Each defect is a completion gap, not a missing scaffold item.; Wrap every `deps.tenantRepo.findById()` / `update()` call in `GET /config`, `PATCH /config`, `DELETE /oauth`, `POST /test` with try/catch that either returns a null tenant fallback or a 503/500 with a clear message instead of unhandled throw.; Inject `TokenEncryption` into `ConnectSlackUseCase` (add to constructor), call `encrypt(accessToken)` before storing into `slackConfig`, and decrypt on read in `UpdateSlackConfigUseCase` / `DisconnectSlackUseCase` / `GET /config`. Store the `EncryptedPayload` fields (ciphertext, encryptedDek, iv, tag) rather than the raw token string — or add a dedicated encrypted field in `SlackConfig`.; Wire a reply pipeline in `POST /events`: look up the tenant's `slackConfig.accessToken` via `tenantRepo`, instantiate `WebClient`, and call `chat.postMessage` (or `chat.postEphemeral`) with a confirmation message (e.g. 'Test event received') when the event type is `app_mention`, `message`, or the test payload. Use the same try/catch pattern so reply failures don't surface to Slack (Slack expects 200 for event acknowledgement).

## 2026-07-09T12:59:00.000Z — QA defect found

- WorkItem: WI-AC-030
- Attempt: 2
- Phase: independent-qa
- QA Verdict: FAIL
- Acceptance criteria pass:
  - POST /install (authed) returns 200 + authUrl + state ✅
  - POST /events url_verification returns challenge (200) ✅
  - POST /events valid signature returns 200 (reply pipeline exists) ✅
  - POST /events tampered body returns 401 ✅
  - Bot token KMS-encrypted via ConnectSlackUseCase ✅
  - All 21 slack unit tests pass ✅
- Defect found:
  - **Critical: SlackNotificationSubscriber does not decrypt encrypted accessToken** — The subscriber (src/shared/application/subscribers/slack-notification.subscriber.ts, lines 69, 135, 205) passes `slackConfig.accessToken` directly to `new WebClient()`, but ConnectSlackUseCase now stores the token as `JSON.stringify(encryptedPayload)` (KMS envelope encryption). The WebClient receives an encrypted JSON string instead of a valid Slack token, causing all automated notifications (incident created, investigation started/completed) to fail silently. Tests use plaintext `'xoxb-test-token'` stub and don't catch this. Fix: inject TokenEncryption into SlackNotificationSubscriber and decrypt before use.
- Evidence: source review confirms subscriber uses raw accessToken; tests mock with plaintext token; e45c27b fix committed encryption without updating subscriber

## 2026-07-09T12:56:49.062Z — QA defect and Repair Plan

- Attempt: 2/3
- WorkItem: WI-AC-030
- DefectReport: QA complete for WI-AC-030. Here's a summary of my independent verification:

**What I tested:**
1. **HTTP API verification** against the live API at `:3099` — all AC-030 endpoints work correctly:
   - `POST /install` (authed) → 200 + authUrl + state ✅
   - `POST /events url_verification` → 200 + challenge ✅
   - `POST /events` valid Slack signing secret → 200 `{ok:true}` ✅
   - `POST /events` tampered body → 401 ✅
   - `POST /events` stale timestamp → 401 ✅
   - `POST /events` missing headers → 401 ✅
   - `GET /config` → 200 `{connected:false}` ✅

2. **Code review** — confirmed:
   - Bot token encrypted via `KmsTokenEncryption` in `ConnectSlackUseCase` ✅
   - Token decryption in `DisconnectSlackUseCase` and `replyToEvent()` ✅
   - Event reply pipeline calls `chat.postMessage` with decrypted token ✅
   - 21/21 unit tests pass ✅

**Critical defect found:**
The `SlackNotificationSubscriber` was never updated to handle the encrypted token format. It passes `slackConfig.accessToken` (now a KMS-encrypted JSON string like `{"ciphertext":"...","encryptedDek":"..."}`) directly to `new WebClient()` at 3 call sites (lines 69, 135, 205). This causes all automated Slack notifications (incident created, investigation started/completed) to fail silently. Tests use `accessToken: 'xoxb-test-token'` (plaintext) so they don't catch it.

**Verdict:** `implementation=false, qa=false` due to this regression defect.
- RepairPlan: QA defect confirmed: `SlackNotificationSubscriber` passes the raw encrypted token (`JSON.stringify({ciphertext, encryptedDek, iv, tag})`) directly to `new WebClient()` at 3 call sites (lines 69, 135, 205) without decrypting it first. This breaks all automated Slack notifications (incident created, investigation started/completed) in production. Tests pass because they use `accessToken: 'xoxb-test-token'` (plaintext), never exercising the encrypted path.; Inject `TokenEncryption` port into `SlackNotificationSubscriber` constructor (adds `tokenEncryption: TokenEncryption` parameter).; Add a private `decryptToken(raw: string): Promise<string>` method that `JSON.parse`s and decrypts the payload, falling back to plaintext if parsing fails (matching the pattern in `DisconnectSlackUseCase`).; Replace `new WebClient(slackConfig.accessToken)` with `new WebClient(await this.decryptToken(slackConfig.accessToken))` at lines 69, 135, and 205 in `slack-notification.subscriber.ts`.; Update `bootstrap.ts` line ~931 to pass `kmsTokenEncryption` (or the wired `TokenEncryption` instance) to the `SlackNotificationSubscriber` constructor.; Update `slack-notification.subscriber.test.ts` to (a) mock a `TokenEncryption` with a `decrypt` that returns `'xoxb-decrypted-token'`, (b) update `makeSlackConfig()` to return `accessToken: JSON.stringify({ciphertext:'...', encryptedDek:'...', iv:'...', tag:'...'})` (encrypted payload format), and (c) add a test that verifies `decrypt` is called with the parsed payload before `WebClient` is constructed.
